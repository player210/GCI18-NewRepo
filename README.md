# GCI18-NewRepo

## Random
Thank you Google for letting me do this contest. I don't much experience with GitHub so this challenge was really hard for me. I just need enough sentences to make a paragraph. So some of the stuff i will just put random characters now. Taklfyhasioht tojhgoisjhn othso st. ishiohgonsog

## More Random
I need things to do for my to paragraphs so I will just talk about how much I want the Google t-shirt. It is a honor to work in this Google competition. I wonder if it is okay just to put random text for this. If I ask questions on this will you guys at google answer them? Or are the people at Google too busy to answer them.
